# Emotion-Detection

Developed a real-time Emotion Detector using Python, incorporating computer vision and deep learning techniques. The project features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Utilized Tkinter to create an intuitive interface for user interaction.

Face Detection: Implemented OpenCV for accurate face detection using a pre-trained classifier.

Deep Learning Model: Employed TensorFlow to load and use a pre-trained emotion detection model, predicting emotions from facial expressions.

User Interaction: Enabled users to upload images and receive real-time emotion predictions through a user-friendly interface.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions during face detection and emotion prediction.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python, computer vision, and deep learning, showcasing the ability to create impactful applications with practical applications in emotion analysis.
